# Hi there, I'm Mike Alexandrovsky! 👋

I'm a freshly graduated Computer Science BSc from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (Class of 2025 🎓).  
I currently work at **Ruby.AI Robotic Technologies Ltd.**, a startup where we cook up futuristic robotic solutions with just the right amount of Python seasoning 🐍🤖.

I have a passion for software development and enjoy tackling programming challenges as if they were puzzles. There’s something deeply satisfying about taking a project from a scribble on a whiteboard to a living, breathing piece of software. Watching your code finally run without errors? Chef’s kiss. 👨‍🍳💻

## About Me

- 💻 Currently exploring various aspects of software development.
- 🧩 Enthusiastic about problem-solving and discovering solutions during the development process.
- 🌟 Special connection with Python <3, proficient in Java, C, C++.
- 🚀 Working on projects like TiktokLiveTool and Instalker.
- 😄 I find joy in the full process of software development, from the initial brainstorming session to seeing a complete and working program. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of a bug-free code!

## Current Projects

### [TVsrael](https://github.com/mikealexx/TVsrael)
TVsrael is an Android app which brings all the free Israeli TV channels to one place.
The project was born after a certain official app (hhmm.. Reshet 13 hhm...) was crashing every 5 minutes and I just wanted to watch TV.
This is my first android project which hopefully will be on the Google Play store.

### [Just Type Bro](https://github.com/mikealexx/JustTypeBro)

> _RIP Just Type Bro: May your transcriptions rest in peace_ ☠️📱📝

Once upon a time, in the wild era *before* May 2025, you were sitting in class, trying not to drool on your notes, when—**ping!**—a voice message from Mom:  
> “Honey, should I use the lavender or the vanilla fabric softener? Also, Aunt Linda says hi!”

You’d sigh, forward it to **Just Type Bro**, and boom—crisis averted, text in hand, dignity intact.

But alas, the bots have retired.  
As of May 2025, WhatsApp finally released **official transcription**, putting our dear Bro out of business.  
No hard feelings—we walked so they could run.

Thanks to everyone who used us to dodge awkward public audio messages. We were proud to serve.  
Now if you’ll excuse us, we’ll be quietly sipping piña coladas in deprecated-bot heaven.

👋 *Goodbye world. It’s been real.*


### Instalker
Instalker is an Instagram user analyzing tool under development. Its main features include the ability to export and compare old/new followers or following users.

### TiktokLiveTool
TiktokLiveTool is a program designed to connect to TikTok live streams using a specific API, allowing interaction with viewers through likes, comments, and gifts. One of the features I aimed for was a text-to-speech system to read comments from viewers who donated or sent a gift. However, due to constant updates in TikTok's API, maintaining compatibility became challenging.
