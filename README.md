# Hi there, I'm Mike Alexandrovsky! 👋

I'm a freshly graduated Computer Science BSc from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology (Class of 2025 🎓).
I currently work at **Ruby.AI Robotic Technologies Ltd.**, a startup where we cook up futuristic robotic solutions with just the right amount of Python seasoning 🐍🤖.

I have a passion for software development and enjoy tackling programming challenges as if they were puzzles. There’s something deeply satisfying about taking a project from a scribble on a whiteboard to a living, breathing piece of software. Watching your code finally run without errors? Chef’s kiss. 👨‍🍳💻

## About Me

- 💻 Currently exploring various aspects of software development.
- 🧩 Enthusiastic about problem-solving and discovering solutions during the development process.
- 🌟 Special connection with Python <3, proficient in Java, C, C++.
- 🚀 Working on projects like TiktokLiveTool and Instalker.
- 😄 I find joy in the full process of software development, from the initial brainstorming session to seeing a complete and working program. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of a bug-free code!

## Current Projects

### [TVsrael](https://github.com/mikealexx/TVsrael)
TVsrael is an Android app which brings all the free Israeli TV channels to one place.
The project was born after a certain official app (hhmm.. Reshet 13 hhm...) was crashing every 5 minutes and I just wanted to watch TV.
This is my first android project which hopefully will be on the Google Play store.

### [Just Type Bro](https://github.com/mikealexx/JustTypeBro)
Imagine this: you're sitting there trying to stay awake as your professor drones on about 19th-century trade routes, and suddenly—ping!—an audio message from Mom. She says, "Sweetie, I was just thinking, should I use the lavender or the vanilla fabric softener? Also, Aunt Linda says hi!"

You roll your eyes, forward it to Just Type Bro, and seconds later, voilà: the entire saga in text, right there for you to read. Now you can scroll, sigh, and silently thank Just Type Bro for saving you from that embarrassing mid-lecture audio blast!

Just Type Bro, your trusty WhatsApp bot that exists solely to transcribe those "urgent" audio messages from Mom while you're, say, in the middle of a lecture (or anywhere Mom knows you can’t respond).

### Instalker
Instalker is an Instagram user analyzing tool under development. Its main features include the ability to export and compare old/new followers or following users.

### TiktokLiveTool
TiktokLiveTool is a program designed to connect to TikTok live streams using a specific API, allowing interaction with viewers through likes, comments, and gifts. One of the features I aimed for was a text-to-speech system to read comments from viewers who donated or sent a gift. However, due to constant updates in TikTok's API, maintaining compatibility became challenging.
