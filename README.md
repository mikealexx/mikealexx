# Hi there, I'm Mike Alexandrovsky! 👋

I'm a third-year Computer Science student at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. I have a passion for software development and enjoy tackling programming challenges as if they were puzzles.

## About Me

- 💻 Currently exploring various aspects of software development.
- 🧩 Enthusiastic about problem-solving and discovering solutions during the development process.
- 🌟 Special connection with Python <3, proficient in Java, C, C++.
- 🚀 Working on projects like TiktokLiveTool and Instalker.
- 😄 I find joy in the full process of software development, from the initial brainstorming session to seeing a complete and working program. There's nothing quite like the satisfaction of a bug-free code!

## Current Projects

### Instalker
Instalker is an Instagram user analyzing tool under development. Its main features include the ability to export and compare old/new followers or following users.

### TiktokLiveTool
TiktokLiveTool is a program designed to connect to TikTok live streams using a specific API, allowing interaction with viewers through likes, comments, and gifts. One of the features I aimed for was a text-to-speech system to read comments from viewers who donated or sent a gift. However, due to constant updates in TikTok's API, maintaining compatibility became challenging.
